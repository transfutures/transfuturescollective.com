# Trans Futures Collective

## _Trans Liberation is Your Liberation_

### Background
Trans Futures Collective began as Trans Yoga Project in July 2020, when eight gender expansive yoga teachers came together to lead a virtual trans inclusion webinar during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2023, after assessing all the ways we have grown and shifted since our inception, the remaining 5 members came to a consensus to change the name to Trans Futures Collective. This allows us to hold space more expansively for our trans and non binary siblings beyond (though still including) yoga.

We support Trans* people's spiritual wellness through community (re)education, advocacy within the yoga and wellness industries, community building, and the creation of supportive and affirming content and guided practices by and for Trans* and non-binary people. This group has committed to both internal and external work in service to ALL Trans*, non-binary, and queer siblings, and thus is vested in dismantling all systems of oppression, including White Supremacy and Capitalism in all of their manifestations.

The collective's members are all queer, Trans*, and non-binary yoga teachers based on stolen lands in California, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Beyond yoga asana, we hold certifications in meditation, classical mantra, reiki, education & doula services.

We offer training modules, workshops, classes, events and private sessions. [Click here](hire-us.md) to hire us!

### Mission
With firm grounding in our values and a clear orientation towards our vision, we commit to cultivating the conditions that allow Trans* people to thrive and to safeguarding Trans* spiritual, mental, and physical wellness by developing both healing and educational resources for our communities. We create and hold space for Trans* people to live wholly and thrive loudly by dismantling barriers to access in yoga and wellness spaces and by offering classes and wellness services as affirming, Trans*-centered containers where our siblings can explore their own inner landscapes, tap into their various innate wisdoms, and co-create healing environments that serve their deepest needs. We further support the Trans* community by (re)educating allied yoga teachers and wellness professionals through trainings and resources that honor the expansive nature of Trans experience and the practices of yoga and liberation.

### Vision
We are teachers, learners, students, and practitioners seeking healing for ourselves and our Transgender, non-binary, and gender-expansive siblings. We collectively embrace abundance, collaboration, joy, speaking our truth, living boldly on our own terms, and supporting one another along the way. We reject assimilation, individualism, imposter syndrome, scarcity, and hierarchy. We are committed to resisting the forces of colonization, white supremacy, and capitalism while aligning with and honoring the values of yoga and the interdependence and divinity of all beings, human and non-human.
