Trans Futures Collective facilitates events and other opportunities for **somatic healing, creative expression, and community-building.**  

As disabled, neurodivergent, and racialized people, we imperfectly center abolition, disability justice, and the neurodiversity paradigm. Through these lenses, ***we view trans futures as powerful, generative, creative, collective, brave, emboedied, and alive.***
