### Workshops 💻
TFC workshops are designed with community conversation in mind centering transgender, gender nonconforming and queer folks. Our workshops are offered on a rolling basis and can be held for small groups, large groups, studio and corporate settings to deepen knowledge and understanding. 

### Trainings 🏫
Integrating trans and queer inclusive content modules into yoga teacher trainings and staff development help ensure new teachers are prepared to commit to culture which radically uplifts diverse identities. Our trainings are rooted in challenging racism, transphobia and ableism while expanding direct support for trans and queer folks within yoga and wellness. Contact us to incorporate an existing 101 or a custom module into your yoga, reiki or doula training!

### Consulting 
Dive deeper into implementing new practices to your team, studio or organization which uplifts authenticity of trans and queer people everywhere. Review studio climate, policies and practices with TYP staff and develop an implementation plan. 

### Private Sessions
Book private classes with TFC facilitators to grow your practice. Our facilitators are formally trained and have significant lived experience with neurodivergence, disability, gender transitions, and somatic trauma processing. Across our team, we offer sessions in accessible yoga, palm healing, vocal training & classical mantra, grief work, self-inquiry and personal coaching.
